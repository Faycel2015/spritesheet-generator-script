# Description

Spritesheet generator is mostly for people who use Photoshop's animation functions and want to easily export their animations into a simple spritesheet. The script has two modes:
- use all direct child layers of a document to be put into a new spritesheet
- select a group which contains layers that you want to export

# Installation

- Windows - C:\Program Files\Adobe\Your photoshop version\Presets\Scripts
- Mac - Applications > Your photoshop version > Presets > Scripts

Restart Photoshop if it was open.
It will now be available under File -> Scripts menu;
